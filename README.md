# Project - Exploring Lending Works' Loan Book (Sept. 2022)

Welcome!

This repository contains supporting datasets and Python jupyter notebooks which I used in my personal project exploring the public loan book data of the peer-to-peer lending provider, [Lending Works](https://www.lendingworks.co.uk/).

The files in this repository are intended to be used as a reference for the presentation delivered to Lending Works senior data team, and aims to outline the process and analytical framework I carried out when exploring the company's lending performance and portfolio profile.

Loan book data has been provided by Lending Works / Fluro and can be found on [their statistics webpage](https://www.lendingworks.co.uk/about-us/statistics).

## File directory:
- Loan_Book.csv : Raw loan book publically available from Lending Works website
- Loans_Data.csv : Loans dataset compiled in processing stage for exploratory analysis
- Borrowers_Data.csv : Borrower profile dataset compiled in processing stage for exploratory analysis
- loan_book_processing.ipynb : Data processing notebook outlining the coding used for cleaning and organising loan book data
- loan_book_analysis.ipynb : Exploratory analysis notebook outlining the coding used for anlysing and summarising loan book data

## Usage:

If you'd like to demo and run the code in the processing and analysis notebooks, make sure to place the CSV datasets in the same directory as the notebooks so they can be accessed.
